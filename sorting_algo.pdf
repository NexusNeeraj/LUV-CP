I appreciate your feedback. Here's an expanded list that includes a few more sorting algorithms along with their time complexity, space complexity, a brief explanation, and stability:

| Sorting Algorithm | Time Complexity           | Space Complexity      | Explanation | Stability |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Bubble Sort       | O(n^2)                     | O(1)                  | Simple and inefficient, repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. | Stable   |
| Selection Sort    | O(n^2)                     | O(1)                  | Sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. | Unstable |
| Insertion Sort    | O(n^2)                     | O(1)                  | Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms. | Stable   |
| Merge Sort        | O(n log n)                 | O(n)                  | A divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. | Stable   |
| Quick Sort        | O(n^2) (worst)              | O(log n) (average)    | Another divide and conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. | Unstable |
| Heap Sort         | O(n log n)                 | O(1)                  | Builds a max-heap (or min-heap) to represent the array and repeatedly removes the maximum (or minimum) element to build the sorted array. | Unstable |
| Counting Sort     | O(n + k)                   | O(k)                  | Assumes that each element in the input is an integer within a specific range. It counts the occurrences of each element and uses that information to reconstruct a sorted sequence. | Stable   |
| Radix Sort        | O(nk)                      | O(n + k)              | Processes the digits of the numbers in a specific order, from the least significant digit to the most significant digit, or vice versa. | Stable   |
| Bucket Sort       | O(n^2) (worst)              | O(n + k)              | Distributes the elements into a number of buckets and then individually sorts each bucket, typically using a different sorting algorithm. | Stable   |
| Shell Sort        | O(n log^2 n) (worst-case)  | O(1)                  | A variation of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart, producing partially sorted arrays that can be efficiently sorted with subsequent passes. | Unstable |
| Cocktail Shaker Sort | O(n^2)                   | O(1)                  | A variation of the bubble sort algorithm that sorts the list in both directions, eliminating turtles (small values near the end) and rabbits (large values near the beginning). | Stable   |
| Comb Sort         | O(n^2) (worst)              | O(1)                  | An improvement over bubble sort that eliminates small values near the end of the list efficiently by using a gap sequence. | Unstable |
| Gnome Sort        | O(n^2)                     | O(1)                  | A simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, similar to the behavior of a gnome sorting a line of flowerpots. | Stable   |

This expanded list includes a variety of sorting algorithms, each with its own characteristics and trade-offs.
